/**
 * Multi-Provider Example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to use the LLM module with multiple providers.
 * It shows how to:
 * 1. Create LLM services for different providers
 * 2. Compare responses from different models
 * 3. Handle provider-specific configurations
 *
 * Note: This example assumes multiple providers are implemented in the LLMServiceFactory.
 * If only one provider is available, this example would need to be modified.
